# Quiz Demo for Jolocom Task

This repo is my submission for the task provided by Jolocom. It is a React Native App  build using Expo.

## Run locally


Clone the repository and install dependencies using:

```yarn install```

You should now be able to start the local dev server using Expo:

```expo start```

For this to work, you need to have [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/get-started/installation/) installed.

Once the server has started, you can run the app on any Emulator or Device which has the Expo Client app installed.
